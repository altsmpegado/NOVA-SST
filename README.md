# NOVA School of Science and Technology - MIEEC Portfolio
Hey there! Welcome to my academic portfolio!

Here, you'll find the most important projects I've worked on during my five years at NOVA School of Science and Technology, where I earned an Integrated Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I'm sticking to a "Time Machine Rule" for this portfolio: every project is presented exactly as it was when I finished it. This way, you can see how I've grown and evolved over the years.

These projects cover various aspects of electrical engineering and computer science, showcasing my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical challenges. From designing and implementing digital systems to developing software solutions or interacting with robotic devices, my work demonstrated proficiency in both hardware and software domains.

This portfolio represents five years of learning, discovery, and growth. It's a journey filled with successes and setbacks that shaped me into an engineer and left me with even more questions.
